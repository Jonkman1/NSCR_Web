We will soon host *our first hybrid NSC-R workshop*. You are very welcome to join us in the Colloquium Room at NSCR, which for the occasion will be labeled the `NSC-R Studio`. The workshop will of course also be hosted on Zoom as usual.

In this NSC-R workshop Harrie Jonkman will show us how to work with `Quarto`. `Quarto` is a tool that helps you write research papers and blogs. It is a modern version of RMarkdown that is part of RStudio. `Quarto` can be used to write (reproducible) research papers and blogs that integrate text with data analysis and visualization. 

After the workshop we should know how `Quarto` works and understand the basic principles of making a blog, and can transfer this knowledge to writing a paper or report (or making a website, or book). 

To profit most from this workshop, you need to have a very basic knowledge of R and R Markdown.
