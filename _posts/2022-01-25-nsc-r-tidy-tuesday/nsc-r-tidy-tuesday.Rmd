The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which was aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data. 

As a continuation of his workshop on January 11, Sam Langton demonstrated some foundational R skills using a [Tidy Tuesday dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-12-21/starbucks.csv) on the nutritional (or not so nutritional) content of Starbucks drinks.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
