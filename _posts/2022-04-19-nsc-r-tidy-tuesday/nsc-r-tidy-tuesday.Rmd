The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which was aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

The [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-04-12/indoor_pollution.csv) for this Tidy Tuesday is about indoor air pollution! **Asier Moneva** explores the following research question: “How have trends in deaths due to household air pollution from solid fuels evolved in the EU countries over the last 30 years?” Feel free to explore this question yourselves and share your experience with us.
