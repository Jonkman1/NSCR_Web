The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which was aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

This Tidy Tuesday happens to take place on 2's day, a palindrome date in the Dutch date notation (2022-22-02).
