The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which is aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

This workshop (March 5, 2024, 13:00-14:00 CET) will be led by Asier Moneva. We will analyze [a Wikipedia-sourced dataset on events that happened on leap days](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-02-27) (i.e. February 29th) and try to answer questions like

  -  Which cohort of leap day births is most represented in Wikipedia's data? 
  -  Are any years surprisingly underrepresented compared to nearby years? 
  -  What other patterns can we find in the data?
