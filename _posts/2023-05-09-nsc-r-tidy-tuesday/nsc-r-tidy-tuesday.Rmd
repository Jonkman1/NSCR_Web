The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which is aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data. 

In this workshop (May 9, 2023, 13:00-14:00), Wim Bernasco will try to model song danceability using a dataset of tracks on Spotify.

Even if you have no interest in popular music at all, you may find the workshop instructive for learning how to do regression analysis in R. 

The workshop will not delve into statistics, but rather show how to get linear regression and logistic regression models running in R and generate useful and reproducible output. The focus will be on ordinary least squares and logistic regression, but the techniques can easily be generalized to other regression models. 

This is a hybrid workshop, physically in the Colloquium Room at NSCR and online on Zoom. To join online, click [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89030539457?pwd=c0tOeG4rYldiWENQY3BVanJXM1UvUT09).
