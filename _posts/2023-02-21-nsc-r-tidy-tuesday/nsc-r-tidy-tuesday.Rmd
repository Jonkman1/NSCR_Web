The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which was aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

In this workshop, Alex Trinidad will show how to write your own R functions. This helps automating your work and making your R scripts cleaner, shorter and easier to maintain.
