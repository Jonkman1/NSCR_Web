The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which was aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

The dataset for next Tidy Tuesday is about board games! Asier Moneva will explore the following research questions: "What are the top 3 best-selling board games by game type?" and "How do board game sales relate to online user ratings?" Feel free to explore these questions yourselves and share your experience with us.
