The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which was aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

The [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-01-25) for this Tidy Tuesday is about board games! [Asier Moneva](https://twitter.com/crimoneva) explores the following research questions: "What are the top 3 best-selling board games by game type?" and "How do board game sales relate to online user ratings?" Feel free to explore these questions yourselves and share your experience with us.
