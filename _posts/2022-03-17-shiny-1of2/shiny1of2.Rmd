In a two-sessions workshop, Nick van Doormaal demonstrated how to use the `shiny` package to create interactive web applications. Note that this was the first session of a two-sesssion workshop. This first session was be a basic introduction on the different components of a shiny app. In the second session (on Thursday March 31) we explored into more depth how 'reactivity' works, an important component of most shiny apps.

For inspiration, you may want to spend a few minutes viewing some [fun apps](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/3-fun-shiny-apps-for-your-long-labor-day-weekend/) made with `shiny`, or [this `shiny` gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

To prepare for the workshop, you could install these two R packages (just copy and paste this line into your R Studio Editor and run it)

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "shiny"))

### How to download files from GitHub

To download files from GitHub you can:

`Clone` the repository to create a local copy in your computer. To clone a repository, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Alternatively, you can:
