The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions draw their inspiration from the Tidy Tuesday initiative, a dedicated platform aimed at fostering a secure and supportive environment for individuals seeking to hone their data processing and visualization skills in R, all while working with real-world data.

This workshop will be the fourth one in the Reading Club format. For details about this format, please read [the post of November 14](https://nscrweb.netlify.app/posts/2023-11-14-nsc-r-workshop-ros/). You can keep up to date with the material for each session via the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/langtonhugh/regression_book_nscr) or via the [Reading Club Notebook](https://rosnotebook.netlify.app/) maintained by Harrie Jonkman.

This workshop will be chaired by Harrie Jonkman. In this session, we will focus on Chapter 4 (on *Statistical inference*, pp. 49-68) of the book *Regression and Other Stories*. To make most of the workshops, we suggest you have a read (however brief!) of the chapter in advance. 

Join this session February 20, 2024 at 13:00 CET on Zoom by clicking [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4539912989) and using the passcode 'NSCR'.
