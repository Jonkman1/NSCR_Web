  If you are a participant of the two-day workshop on Using R for Reproducible Social Science, these notes may be useful to help you install R Studio and R on your computer. If you work from a NSCR laptop, you can skip this guide because you can use the remote desktop server.

To participate in the workshop **Using R for Reproducible Social Science**, you need to have access to a working R installation. This can be an installation on a remote computer (for NSCR participants) or a local installation on your laptop (for all others). 

If you need to create a local installation on your laptop (i.e. if you are not an NSCR participant), please visit the [Data Carpentries website](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/setup.html) for installations instructions (both Windows and MacOS). You can ignore the text under the header "For everyone".
