To participate in the workshop **Using R for Reproducible Social Science**, you need to have access to a working R installation. This can be an installation on a remote computer (for NSCR participants) or a local installation on your laptop (for all others). 

For those who need to create a local installation on their laptop (i.e. the non-NSCR participants), below is a brief description on how to download the necessary software (it is free) and install it.

There are two pieces of software that must be installed: *R* and *R Studio*. At this point in time it is not important to understand how they relate, but you can think of R Studio as a car and of R as its motor. 

1. **Remove any existing versions of both R Studio and R from the computer.** 
2. **Delete any lingering folders associated with R Studio or *R***
3. **Install *R*** 
    a.	Navigate to [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
    b.	As of September 27, 2022, the latest version is 4.2.1.
    c.	Click “Download R-4.2.1 for Windows”. See below.
    d.	Run the downloaded application. Accepting defaults.
4. **Install *R Studio***
    a.	Navigate to [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
    b.	Scroll down and click download on the free version of “RStudio Desktop”.
    c.	As of September 27, 2022, the latest version is 2022.07.2+576.
    d.	On the following page, assuming you have installed R already (see above), click “Download RStudio for Windows”.
    e.	Run the downloaded application. Accepting defaults.
5. **To start working with R, you only need to open *R Studio***
