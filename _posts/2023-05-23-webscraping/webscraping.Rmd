This is a hybrid workshop (May 23,2023, 13:00-14:00), physically in the Breakout Room at NSCR and online on Zoom. To join online, click [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82224521098?pwd=ZG1wbXp0VllLc29DdEZ2eVlhT0lKQT09).

In this NSC-R workshop Danielle van Westbroek-Stibbe will describe and demonstrate web scraping in R. **Web scraping** involves the extraction of data from websites, which can be done manually (e.g., copy-pasting) or automatically. This process extends beyond existing datasets, allowing you to retrieve any type of data found on a webpage. Once the information is saved to disk in HTML format, we can **parse** it to become more readable.

In this workshop, Danielle will demonstrate how we can use the R package "rvest" to extract data from the NSC-R Workshops website. During this demonstration, she will create a comprehensive dataset that encompasses the workshops conducted with the NSC-R community.

Content of the workshop:

  - What is web scraping and what is it used for? 
  - HTML basics
  - Web scraping and parsing in R

Required packages:

  - For web scraping and parsing: rvest
  - For tidy coding: dplyr
