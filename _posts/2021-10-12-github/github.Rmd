Version control is essential for keeping track of data analysis projects. it is also essential for collaboration with other researchers and developers. Git, GitHub in combination with R/RStudio allow you to back up texts and scripts and to collaborate on complex projects. Git and GitHub are open source version control systems which work quiet well together with R/RStudio. In this workshop you will be introduced to this system, you understand how to open a repository on GitHub and how this works in R/RStudio. Also will be shown how collaboration works in a simple repository/project. This workshop is connected to the next workshop in which the new NSC-R website will be presented. This website is developed by the NSC-R teammembers who worked together on this in Git, GitHub and R/RStudio and deployed the GitHub pages in Netlify.
