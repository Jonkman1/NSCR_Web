The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which is aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data. 

This workshop (October 31, 2023, 13:00-14:00) will be led by Danielle van Westbroek-Stibbe. Join this online workshop on Zoom [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87671700917?pwd=aThJWkpzNEtESE40M2VzdnlodXEzdz09) (meeting ID: 876 7170 0917, Password: 455700)

Using data from ScoobyPedia, we will practice data wrangling and visualization techniques taught in our recent Carpentry course "R for Social Scientists" to answer those questions and more.

The data we will use is provided and described by the Tidy Tuesday Initiative, and can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-13/readme.md)."
