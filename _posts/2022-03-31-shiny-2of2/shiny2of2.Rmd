In a two-sessions workshop, Nick van Doormaal will demonstrate how to use the `shiny` package to create interactive web applications. Note that this is the second session of a two-sesssion workshop. The first session (on Thursday March 17) was be a basic introduction on the different components of a shiny app. In this second session we explore into more depth how 'reactivity' works, an important component of most shiny apps.

To prepae for the workshop, you may want to take a look this [key resource](https://mastering-shiny.org/) for `shiny`, in particular Chapter 3.

In advance of the workshop, we suggest you install these two R packages (just copy and paste this line into your R Studio Editor and run it)

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "shiny"))
