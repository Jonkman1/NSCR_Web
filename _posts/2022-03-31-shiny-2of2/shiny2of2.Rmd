In a two-sessions workshop, Nick van Doormaal will demonstrate how to use the `shiny` package to create interactive web applications. Note that this is the second session of a two-sesssion workshop. The first session (on Thursday March 17) will be a basic introduction on the different components of a shiny app. In this second session we explore into more depth how 'reactivity' works, an important component of most shiny apps.

For inspiration, you may want to spend a few minutes viewing some [fun apps](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/3-fun-shiny-apps-for-your-long-labor-day-weekend/) made with `shiny`, or [this `shiny` gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

To prepare for the workshop, you could install these two R packages (just copy and paste this line into your R Studio Editor and run it)

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "shiny"))
