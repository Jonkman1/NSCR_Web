The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the 
[Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which is aimed at 
providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing 
and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

This workshop (Tuesday April 30, 2024, 13:00-14:00 CET) is the last in a series of three 
about the use of ChatGPT in R. Together the three workshops form a beginners' 
course on how to integrate ChatGPT when working with R. They will be led by Abby Onencan.

**The previous workshops in this course are on Monday April 2 and on monday April 15, 13:00-14:00**.
