R packages are collections of functions and datasets that extend the base functionality of R. You are already familar with them because whenever you type, for example, `library(dplyr)` in your R script you are using a package `dplyr' and its functions.
In this workshop **Sophie Curtis-Ham** will demonstrate how you yourself can create R packages. 

Note that the workshop is in the morning: **10:00-11:00**. Join this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking [this link]( https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83201028780?pwd=bVV6dnlWZFdmYUFINElBczhYZGlJQT09)
