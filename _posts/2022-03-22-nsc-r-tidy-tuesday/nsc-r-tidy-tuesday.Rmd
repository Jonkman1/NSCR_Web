The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which was aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

Sports in general and football (soccer) in particular is a sheer endless source of open data that can studied at various levels (player, team, match, competition) from various perspectives. In this meeting Wim will use open data about football borrowed from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata)  maintained by James Curley (James P. Curley (2016). engsoccerdata: English Soccer Data 1871-2016. R package version 0.1.5 DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13158).

The repository contains data on football matches from the UK Premier League and other European leagues. In this Tidy Tuesday we will use data from almost a complete century (1929-2020) football in the Spanish League called **La Liga**.

We will try to answer a couple of simple questions:

1. Is it true that there are less goals today than in earlier days?

2. Is the number of goals related to the season?

3. Is playing home really an advantage?

4. If so, has this advantage changed over time?

Here is a [tiny R script](https://github.com/bernasco/a_century_football_in_spain) that helps you to start up. It installs packages, loads libraries and reads the data set.
