### What are the NSC-R Workshops?

The **NSC-R Workshops** is a series of one-hour online instructional sessions to support participants in developing their data science skills in R, and to promote open science principles. The NSC-R workshop meetings are organized by a team affiliated with the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement [(NSCR)](https://www.nscr.nl/en/), but they are open to everyone, regardless of affiliation or skill level. 

There are workshops on specific topics (e.g. network analysis, missing values) and `Tidy Tuesday` workshops that cover more basic skills and materials. A collection of these latter workshop materials have been brought together by Harrie Jonkman in a single document that you can find [here](  https://ttbook.netlify.app/).  

### The NSC-R Workshop Team

The NSC-R Workshop Team coordinates the NSC-R Workshops. They discuss potential topics, invite presenters, plan the meetings and send invitations. Currently the team includes Abby Onencan, Alex Trinidad, Asier Moneva, Danielle van Westbroek-Stibbe, Franziska Yasrebi-de Kom, Sam Langton and Wim Bernasco.
