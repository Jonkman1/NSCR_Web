The NSC-R workshop meetings are organized by a team mostly affiliated with the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR), but they are open to everyone, regardless of affiliation or skill level.\r\nThere are workshops on specific topics (e.g. network analysis, missing values) and Tidy Tuesday workshops that cover more basic skills and materials. A collection of these latter workshop materials have been brought together by Harrie Jonkman in a single document that you can find here.\r\nStarting November 2023 we are transforming the workshops on specific topics into a reading group, where we explore the world of data analysis using the book Regression and other stories by Gelman, Hill and Vehtari as a source of inspiration. Click here for more information.\r\nThe NSC-R Workshop Team\r\nThe NSC-R Workshop Team coordinates the NSC-R Workshops. They discuss potential topics, invite presenters, plan the meetings and send invitations. Currently the team includes Abby Onencan, Alex Trinidad, Anne Coomans, Asier Moneva, Danielle van Westbroek-Stibbe, Ida Adamse, Sam Langton and Wim Bernasco.\r\nContact Us and Get involved\r\nIf you want your e-mail address on (or off) our mailing list, please send an e-mail to Wim Bernasco at wbernasco@nscr.nl.\r\nIf you have suggestions for workshop topics, or are interested in presenting one, please send a message to\r\nIda Adamse (iadamse@nscr.nl)\r\nWim Bernasco (wbernasco@nscr.nl),\r\nAnne Coomans (acoomans@nscr.nl),\r\nSam Langton (slangton@nscr.nl),\r\nAsier Moneva (amoneva@nscr.nl),\r\nAbby Onencan (onencan@law.eur.nl),\r\nAlex Trinidad (atrinidad@nscr.nl), or\r\nDanielle van Westbroek-Stibbe (DStibbe@nscr.nl).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There are hundreds of them, for specific tasks. It can be overwhelming, esp. if multiple packages offer similar possibilities (i.e. inter-rater reliability assessment)\r\nYou can do it by commandline (take away #)\r\n\r\n\r\n# install.packages(\"ggExtra\")\r\n\r\n\r\nOr via menu (Tools-Install packages) or pane Packages (Install).\r\nAfter installing: load package (one per session, typically at the top of yur script/syntax)\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggExtra)\r\n\r\n\r\nRead section 1.6.1 carefully. It is about how to organize your script\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
