The NSC-R workshops are organized by a team affliated people at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR), but are open to everyone, regardless of affiliation or skill level.\nNSC-R Workshop Team\nThe NSC-R Workshop Team coordinates the NSC-R Workshops. We discuss potential topics, invite presenters, plan the meetings and send invitations. Currently the team includes Wim Bernasco, Sam Langton, Asier Moneva and Alex Trinidad.\nContact Us and Get involved\nIf you want your e-mail address on our mailing list, please send an e-mail to Wim Bernasco at wbernasco@nscr.nl.\nIf you have suggestions for workshop topics, or are interested in presenting one, please send a message to Wim Bernasco (wbernasco@nscr.nl), Asier Moneva (amoneva@nscr.nl), Sam Langton (slangton@nscr.nl) or Alex Trinidad (atrinidad@nscr.nl).\n\n\n\n",
