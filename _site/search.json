We host workshops and social events where attendees can learn and work on projects among friends and colleagues. NSC-R welcomes everyone who wants to better their know-how in all things data, regardless of skill level. We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn and share.\r\nContact Us and Get involved\r\nWhether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or expert, we want you to be involved with the NSC-R workshops. There are different ways to get involved\r\n1. Slack\r\nJoin the NSC-R slack workspace and be part of our co-learning community. Everyone is welcome. Ask Questions and team up with other members.\r\n2. Mailing List\r\nJoin the mailing list. If you have interest, please email to join.\r\n3. Suggest a Workshop\r\nWe’re all learners in NSC-R. Request a workshop, and if you are interested in helping teach it, we’ll support you!\r\nxxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There are hundreds of them, for specific tasks. It can be overwhelming, esp. if multiple packages offer similar possibilities (i.e. inter-rater reliability assessment)\r\nYou can do it by commandline (take away #)\r\n\r\n\r\n# install.packages(\"ggExtra\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr via menu (Tools-Install packages) or pane Packages (Install). After installing: load package (one per session, typically at the top of yur script/syntax)\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggExtra)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead section 1.6.1 carefully. It is about how to organize your script\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
