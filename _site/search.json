The NSC-R workshop meetings are organized by a team affliated with the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR), but they are open to everyone, regardless of affiliation or skill level.\r\nThe NSC-R Workshop Team\r\nThe NSC-R Workshop Team coordinates the NSC-R Workshops. They discuss potential topics, invite presenters, plan the meetings and send invitations. Currently the team includes Alex Trinidad, Asier Moneva, Danielle van Westbroek-Stibbe, Franziska Yasrebi-de Kom, Sam Langton and Wim Bernasco.\r\nContact Us and Get involved\r\nIf you want your e-mail address on our mailing list, please send an e-mail to Wim Bernasco at wbernasco@nscr.nl.\r\nIf you have suggestions for workshop topics, or are interested in presenting one, please send a message to\r\nWim Bernasco (wbernasco@nscr.nl),\r\nSam Langton (slangton@nscr.nl),\r\nAsier Moneva (amoneva@nscr.nl),\r\nAlex Trinidad (atrinidad@nscr.nl),\r\nDanielle van Westbroek-Stibbe (DStibbe@nscr.nl), or\r\nFranziska Yasrebi-de Kom (FYasrebi@nscr.nl).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There are hundreds of them, for specific tasks. It can be overwhelming, esp. if multiple packages offer similar possibilities (i.e. inter-rater reliability assessment)\r\nYou can do it by commandline (take away #)\r\n\r\n\r\n# install.packages(\"ggExtra\")\r\n\r\n\r\nOr via menu (Tools-Install packages) or pane Packages (Install).\r\nAfter installing: load package (one per session, typically at the top of yur script/syntax)\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggExtra)\r\n\r\n\r\nRead section 1.6.1 carefully. It is about how to organize your script\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
