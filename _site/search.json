NSC-R welcomes everyone who wants to better their know-how in all things data, regardless of skill level. We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn and share.\nContact Us and Get involved\nWhether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or expert, we want you to be involved with the NSC-R workshops. There are different ways to get involved\n1. Slack\nJoin the NSC-R slack workspace and be part of our co-learning community. Everyone is welcome. Ask Questions and team up with other members.\n2.
