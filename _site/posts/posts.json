You can name it whatever you want, but it is good practice to not include spaces. So, perhaps call it something like “tidytuesday_may2022”.\r\nOpen up RStudio. In the top left, you will see blue cube icon which when you hover over it will say Create a project. Click on this icon, choose existing directory, Browse, and then find and select the folder you have just created (e.g., tidytuesday_may2022). Once the folder has been selected, click Create Project.\r\nYou are now working in an R Project, hooray! One major benefit of working within an R Project is that all your working directories will now begin wherever the project is located (i.e., the tidytuesday_may2022 folder). Try this now by running getwd() in the R Console. If you save all your data, scripts and project materials here, or in subfolders, you will find it way easier to manage your work, and your code will look cleaner too, courtesy of the shorter working directories.\r\nLet’s start by creating some relevant folders in our project folder. You can do this manually, but let’s try it in RStudio. In the R Console, just type and run dir.create(\"scripts\"). This should have created a new folder called scripts in your project folder. You can save all your scripts here. Try it again for our data folder: dir.create(\"data\"). These subfolders should now existing within your project folder.\r\nFor the workshop, we are going to use some open data on 911 calls in Detroit, United States. I have written a very short script which loads the data automatically. You just need to download this script, save it in the scripts folder, and run it. You can find the script here. Either copy and paste the code into an R script, or right click on Raw (right hand side) and click Save link as…. Remember to save the script in your scripts folder.\r\nOpen up the script and run it. It should download the data automatically and then end with a brief summary of the data thanks to glimpse().\r\nTry to figure out the following. No pressure – you can ask us about anything queries or problems you have during the workshop!\r\nWhat variable names are in the data?\r\nHow many 911 calls for service (i.e., rows) do we have?\r\nWhat is the average response time (totalresponsetime) for calls?\r\nWhat is the most common call type? The call type is defined by the calldescription variable.\r\nHow many calls were in-progress shots fired (‘SHOTS FIRED IP’)?\r\nHow does average response time differ between call types? Here, you might want to use group_by().\r\nExplore some temporal trends. What hours of the day have the highest frequency of shots fired? Here, you will want to make use of functions in the lubridate package.\r\nSee you on Tuesday!\r\n\r\nSam Langton is a postdoc researcher on the evidence-based policing programme at the NSCR. His research focuses on describing and explaining the spatial and temporal patterning of police demand. Sam is interested in promoting open science in criminology, particularly through open data and sharing his knowledge (and struggles) in R.\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\nAll you need is the script mentioned above, which can be viewed here. Either copy and paste the code into an R script, or right click on Raw (right hand side) and click Save link as…. Remember to save the script in your scripts folder (see above).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

One (crime.csv) contains the number of police recorded residential burglaries, bike thefts and assaults in the Netherlands per month between January 2012 and April 2022. The other (population.csv) contains the number of inhabitants of the Netherlands during the same period, per first day of the month (below, in the Materials section, you can find a link to the R script that creates these files by downloading open data from Statistics Netherlands).\r\nIn the workshop we will together try to make sense of long-term temporal trends in these crimes, and hopefully also make useful statements about how things changed when the COVID pandemic arrived around February 2020.\r\nWe would suggest you just spend a single hour on preparation, no matter how far you get. Use any help you can find. Even very experienced R users consult the help files, their colleagues and the internet all the time, and so should you. Make sure you keep your R code in a script that you could share in the workshop, so we can learn from your ideas and creativity, and from your issues and errors.\r\nCreate a new folder on the computer where you run R, and store the two datafiles crime.csv and residents.csv in the folder.\r\nRead both files from disk and assign each a name. Any name will do, but I suggest “crime” and “ residents”.\r\nExplore the structure of the files. How many rows (observations), how many columns (variables), what are the variable names? What are their types: Are they integers, characters, dates, factors, …? keys?\r\nVisualize (plot) the development of the population size of the Netherlands between January 2012 and April 2022, and do the same for the frequencies of residential burglary, bike theft and assault.\r\nCreate a residential burglary rate by relating number of residential burglaries to the size of the population, and think about how you can adjust for different months having a differentnumbers of days (28-31). To do this, you will need to merge (join) the “crime” dataframe with the “residents” dataframe by year and month.\r\nVisualize the development of the three crime rates.\r\nWhat can we say about the development of crime since February 2020, relative to the developments between 2012 and 2020? How can you quantify this with the data at hand?\r\nDo anything else with the data that you find fun or seems to make sense\r\n\r\nWim Bernasco is senior researcher at NSCR and professor at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His work focuses on the geography of crime, incuding crime location choice and offender mobility. Read more on his personal website.\r\n\r\nMaterials & Instructions\r\nThe datasets crimes.csv and population.csv, the R script that created these datasets, and the R script that analyses them is in this GitHub repository.\r\nHow to download files from GitHub\r\nTo download files from GitHub you can:\r\nClone the repository to create a local copy in your computer. To clone a repository, follow the instructions here.\r\nAlternatively, you can:\r\nDownload all files compressed in a ZIP.

R package version 0.1.5 DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13158).\r\nThe engsoccerdata repository contains data on football matches from the UK Premier League and other European football leagues. In this Tidy Tuesday used data from almost a complete century (1929-2020) of matches in the Spanish League called La Liga.\r\nWe tried to answer a couple of simple questions:\r\nIs it true that there are less goals today than in earlier days?\r\nIs the number of goals related to the season of the year?\r\nIs playing home really an advantage?\r\nIf so, has this advantage changed over time?\r\n\r\nWim Bernasco is a senior researcher at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR) and a professor in Spatial analysis of crime at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

    "contents": "\r\nAccording to David Buil-Gil, victimization surveys provide key information about crimes known and unknown to the police, and are the main source of data to analyse perceived safety and confidence in policing. These surveys, however, are only designed to allow aggregating responses and producing reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation techniques may be used to improve the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are applied to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. This workshop will introduce theory and show a step-by-step exemplar study in R to illustrate the utility of small area estimation for crime and place research. You find materials here.

    "contents": "\r\nThis workshop covered the basics of the tidyverse – a collection of packages in R which can be used to import, tidy, transform and visualise data. The material is suitable for people with very little experience in R, but also seasoned R users who have not yet delved into the tidyverse. The skills covered were foundational and generic to almost any research project. The workshop centred around a demonstration which tackles a realistic, ‘messy’ dataset about animal rescue incidents dealt with by the London Fire Brigade.\r\n\r\nSam Langton is a postdoc researcher on the evidence-based policing programme at the NSCR. His research focuses on describing and explaining the spatial and temporal patterning of police demand. Sam is interested in promoting open science in criminology, particularly through open data and sharing his knowledge (and struggles) in R.\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\nYou can find the material for this workshop on GitHub or alternatively on Dropbox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Wouter and Stijn presented parts of what they prepared for a recent book chapter (in press). Here you can find the data, the syntax and the html-file presented in the workshop meeting.\r\n\r\nWouter is a Senior Researcher at the NSCR. For analyses he has used Excel, SPSS, Stata Mplus, MLWiN, and QGis. Not a big fan of C++ and Java, but once upon a time he knew the basics. Wouter started using R around 2012, due to a collaboration with a visiting scholar who used R. Classic case of SIR model (Susceptible - Infection - Recovery) although he has never recovered from his R infection. Also, the R bug destroyed his interest in the above-mentioned programs :-). His main research interests are in spatial patterns of crime and quantitative research methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nStijn is a Senior Researcher and management team member at the NSCR. He is program leader of two of its five research groups, and also Professor at the Department of Sociology, Utrecht University. Stijn has used R ever since he attended the Summer School in Ann Arbor in 2004, even for generating his kitchen tiling pattern. His main research interests are in Geographic and Environmental Criminology, Policing, Quantitative, Analytical, and Computational Sociology, and he is a great believer in Open Science and Open-source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Alex Trinidad introduced us to spatial data and how they can be processed in R.\r\nLearning to work with spatial data allows us to broaden our toolbox and our research horizons. In this workshop, we worked on the basic concepts of spatial data usage, data preparation, and basic visualisations. The aim was to introduce you to how to work with spatial data in R and provide materials that helped to go deeper into this type of data.\r\nTo prepare for the meeting, Alex suggested you might want to take a look at the following links. This is obviously not mandatory, but the materials may give rise to ideas or questions that you may want to discuss in the workshop meeting:\r\nLovelance, R., Nowosad, J., & Muenchow, J. Geocomputation with R. CRC Press.\r\nBivand, R. S., Pebesba, E., & Gómez-Rubio, V. Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R. Springer.(Access from university library)\r\nAlex’ scripts and data you can find here.\r\n\r\nAlex is a postdoctoral researcher/ lecturer at the Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology (ISS) at the University of Cologne, Germany. He is also a research fellow at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR). His interest in spatial analysis began when he started his PhD, exploring the spatial distribution of juvenile delinquency and the contextual factors associated with it. It was also during his PhD that he began his journey with R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nMarkdown is a language for producing formatted text with a simple text editor conceived with the idea of being human-readable from source. If you remember Thomas de Graaff’s talk from two weeks ago, having human readable code is important for a number of reasons, such as being easy to debug, maintain, and extend.\r\nRMarkdown is simply a software that allows the implementation of this language in R. This makes it possible to produce open-access, fully reproducible documents.\r\nHere you can find Asier’s presentation, scripts and additional materials.\r\nTo show you the basics, Asier followed the book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Xie, Allaire and Grolemund. He recommends you read the Preface before the workshop. However, as a definitive guide, you can deduce that this book does not only cover the basics, so you can also use it to go deeper.\r\nOnce you have mastered tha basics of RMarkdown, you might want to take a look at the RMarkdown Cookbook\r\nTo have all the main commands at hand, you can print this double-sided RMarkdown cheat sheet. (We love cheat sheets.)\r\nAnd for a quick overview of RMarkdown, just watch this video.\r\nHere you can find an Elsevier template for RMarkdown\r\n\r\nAsier is a postdoc at the NSCR and The Hague University of Applied Sciences with a background in criminology. He started specializing in crime analysis with R during his master’s degree and has since developed an interest in open science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
