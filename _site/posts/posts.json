We do it all the time, when we shop for new clothes, select a dish from the menu, choose to commute by bus, train or bike, select a job or an applicant, or when we swipe potential partners on Tinder.\r\nDiscrete spatial choice is when the alternatives are spatial entities, e.g. when we choose where to buy a house, where to go on holiday, or where to commit a crime. With data on what has been chosen and on what could have been chosen, discrete choice models can help us understand the decision process and predict its outcome: how do features of the alternatives (e.g. monetary cost of profits, distance, comfort, taste, looks) affect which alternative is chosen?\r\nIn this workshop, Wim Bernasco will explain the key elements of discrete choice models, just enough for you to get going and still know what you are doing. Subsequently he will show what the necessary data look like, how they can be organized, and how discrete choice models can be estimated in R.\r\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking this link\r\n\r\nWim Bernasco is senior researcher at NSCR and professor at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

    "contents": "\r\nNetwork analysis is a topic of growing interest in criminology and beyond. This workshop gives a short introduction and overview of network analysis in R, beginning with a conceptual discussion of what networks are. In their simplest form, networks are comprised of actors (“nodes”) and relationships between them (“edges”). Network analysis concerns the analytical approach to study these edges between nodes of any kind (e.g., individuals, businesses, experiences, words, or streets). The workshop proceeds with an introduction to network analysis in R, focusing on i) creating and reading network data; ii) describing and visualizing networks; and iii) explaining the formation of networks.\r\nJoin this workshop meeting on Thursday January 20, 2022 at 13:00 on Zoom by clicking this link\r\nTo prepare for the workshop, you may want to install a few R packages (just copy and paste these lines into your R Studio Editor and run them):\r\ninstall.packages(“tidyverse”)\r\ninstall.packages(“igraph”)\r\ninstall.packages(“tidygraph”)\r\ninstall.packages(“ggraph”)\r\ninstall.packages(“statnet”)\r\n\r\nIeke de Vries is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology at Leiden University. In her current work, she applies a network approach to examine co-arrest and spatial networks in Chicago, social and spatial networks in the context of human trafficking, and networks of victimizing experiences and behaviors. Besides conducting her research mostly in R, she has also taught an ‘Introduction to Computational Statistics in R’ to graduate students and ‘Programming with Data in Python’ to undergraduate students at Northeastern University and a Summer Course on ‘Crime, Data, and Ethics’ to honours students at Leiden University.\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\nMaterials for the workshop are available at Github.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nAccording to David Buil-Gil, victimization surveys provide key information about crimes known and unknown to the police, and are the main source of data to analyse perceived safety and confidence in policing. These surveys, however, are only designed to allow aggregating responses and producing reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation techniques may be used to improve the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are applied to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. This workshop will introduce theory and show a step-by-step exemplar study in R to illustrate the utility of small area estimation for crime and place research. You find materials here. And his presentation here\r\n\r\nDavid Buil-Gil is a Lecturer in Quantitative Criminology at the Department of Criminology of the University of Manchester, and a core member of the Manchester Centre for Digital Trust and Society. His research areas cover geographic criminology, small area estimation applications in criminology, measurement error in criminological research, new methods for data collection, and open data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
