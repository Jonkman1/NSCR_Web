Multiple imputation is a generic approach to analyse incomplete data that reduces bias and increases precision.\r\nTo get an idea of what the workshop is about, you could read (in Dutch) his short and accessible overview of multiple imputation. Alternatively, you could also check out the (English) Wikipedia page.\r\nTo install the R package mice , copy and paste the next line into your R Studio Editor and run it:\r\ninstall.packages(“mice”)\r\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking this link\r\n\r\nStef van Buuren is Professor of Statistical Analysis of Incomplete Data at the University of Utrecht and Principal Scientist at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO in Leiden.

It is also essential for collaboration with other researchers and developers.\r\nGit, GitHub in combination with R/RStudio allow you to back up texts and scripts and to collaborate on complex projects. Git and GitHub are open source version control systems which work quiet well together with R/RStudio.\r\nThis workshop introduced this system, demonstrated how to create a repository on GitHub, and how to do this from R/RStudio (see Harrie’s presentation (PDF)).\r\nThe workshop also included a live demonstration of how collaboration between multiple people works in a simple repository/project.\r\nThe workshop was connected to the subsequent workshop in which the new NSC-R Workshop website was be presented (the one you are reading now). This website is developed by the NSC-R team members who worked together on this in Git, GitHub and R/RStudio.\r\nMore information\r\nBelow are links to potentially usefull sources about Git, Github and their integration with R/RStudio.\r\nDouglas, A., Roos, D., Mancini, F., Couto, A. and Lusseau, D., An introduction to R, chapter 9, here.\r\nBryan, J., Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, here\r\nLendway, L., github_for_collaboration, here\r\nLisa Lendway on YouTube\r\nUsing Git and GitHub in R Studio\r\nUsing Git and GitHub in R\r\n\r\nHarrie Jonkmanis a senior researcher at the Verwey Jonker Institute.

    "contents": "\r\nAccording to David Buil-Gil, victimization surveys provide key information about crimes known and unknown to the police, and are the main source of data to analyse perceived safety and confidence in policing. These surveys, however, are only designed to allow aggregating responses and producing reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation techniques may be used to improve the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are applied to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. This workshop will introduce theory and show a step-by-step exemplar study in R to illustrate the utility of small area estimation for crime and place research. You find materials here. And his presentation here\r\n\r\nDavid Buil-Gil is a Lecturer in Quantitative Criminology at the Department of Criminology of the University of Manchester, and a core member of the Manchester Centre for Digital Trust and Society. His research areas cover geographic criminology, small area estimation applications in criminology, measurement error in criminological research, new methods for data collection, and open data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For analyses he has used Excel, SPSS, Stata Mplus, MLWiN, and QGis. Not a big fan of C++ and Java, but once upon a time he knew the basics. Wouter started using R around 2012, due to a collaboration with a visiting scholar who used R. Classic case of SIR model (Susceptible - Infection - Recovery) although he has never recovered from his R infection. Also, the R bug destroyed his interest in the above-mentioned programs :-). His main research interests are in spatial patterns of crime and quantitative research methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nStijn is a Senior Researcher and management team member at the NSCR. He is program leader of two of its five research groups, and also Professor at the Department of Sociology, Utrecht University. Stijn has used R ever since he attended the Summer School in Ann Arbor in 2004, even for generating his kitchen tiling pattern. His main research interests are in Geographic and Environmental Criminology, Policing, Quantitative, Analytical, and Computational Sociology, and he is a great believer in Open Science and Open-source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In this workshop, we worked on the basic concepts of spatial data usage, data preparation, and basic visualisations.

If you remember Thomas de Graaff’s talk from two weeks ago, having human readable code is important for a number of reasons, such as being easy to debug, maintain, and extend.\r\nRMarkdown is simply a software that allows the implementation of this language in R. This makes it possible to produce open-access, fully reproducible documents.\r\nHere you can find Asier’s presentation, scripts and additional materials.\r\nTo show you the basics, Asier followed the book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Xie, Allaire and Grolemund. He recommends you read the Preface before the workshop. However, as a definitive guide, you can deduce that this book does not only cover the basics, so you can also use it to go deeper.\r\nOnce you have mastered tha basics of RMarkdown, you might want to take a look at the RMarkdown Cookbook\r\nTo have all the main commands at hand, you can print this double-sided RMarkdown cheat sheet. (We love cheat sheets.)\r\nAnd for a quick overview of RMarkdown, just watch this video.\r\nHere you can find an Elsevier template for RMarkdown\r\n\r\nAsier is a postdoc at the NSCR and The Hague University of Applied Sciences with a background in criminology.
