Following a brief introductory presentation (e.g. definitions, purpose) the bulk of the workshop will focus on practical examples which demonstrate how to obtain and handle open data within the R environment.\nNo prior reading is necessary, but if you might want to skim through a recent book chapter (in press) by Sam and Reka Solymosi on using open data in R to study the geography of crime.\nHere you can find his materials: Sams presentation (presentation.pdf), his syntax (demo.R) and the results of his syntax (worksheet.pdf)\n\nSam Langron is a postdoc researcher on the evidence-based policing programme at the NSCR. His research focuses on the spatial and temporal patterning of crime and police demand.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nThe third meeting of the NSC-R Workshop was on Thursday September 2, 13:00-14:00 hr. Alex Trinidad introduced us to spatial data and how they can be processed in R.\nLearning to work with spatial data allows us to broaden our toolbox and our research horizons. In this workshop, we worked on the basic concepts of spatial data usage, data preparation, and basic visualisations. The aim was to introduce you to how to work with spatial data in R and provide materials that helped to go deeper into this type of data.\nTo prepare for the meeting, Alex suggested you might want to take a look at the following links. This is obviously not mandatory, but the materials may give rise to ideas or questions that you may want to discuss in the workshop meeting:\nLovelance, R., Nowosad, J., & Muenchow, J. Geocomputation with R. CRC Press.\nBivand, R. S., Pebesba, E., & Gómez-Rubio, V. Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R. Springer.(Access from university library)\nScripts and data you can find here.\n\nAlex is a postdoctoral researcher at the NSCR and the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU. His interest in spatial analysis began when he started his PhD, exploring the spatial distribution of juvenile delinquency and the contextual factors associated with it. It was also during his PhD that he began his journey with R.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nMarkdown is a language for producing formatted text with a simple text editor conceived with the idea of being human-readable from source. If you remember Thomas de Graaff’s talk from two weeks ago, having human readable code is important for a number of reasons, such as being easy to debug, maintain, and extend.\nRMarkdown is simply a software that allows the implementation of this language in R. This makes it possible to produce open-access, fully reproducible documents.\nTo show you the basics, Asier followed the book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Xie, Allaire and Grolemund. He recommends you read the Preface before the workshop. However, as a definitive guide, you can deduce that this book does not only cover the basics, so you can also use it to go deeper.\nTo have all the main commands at hand, you can print this double-sided RMarkdown cheat sheet. (We love cheat sheets.)\nAnd for a quick overview of RMarkdown, just watch this video.\nHere you find the presentation, scripts and additional materials.\nHere you find am Elsevier template\n\nAsier is a postdoc at the NSCR and The Hague University of Applied Sciences with a background in criminology. He started specializing in crime analysis with R during his master’s degree and has since developed an interest in open science.\n\n\n\n\n",

The focus was not on why (we should know), but on practical guidelines on how to do it. It was presented by Thomas de Graaff.\nHere you find the presentation\nTo prepare for the first meeting, Thomas de Graaff suggested you might want to take a look at the following links.
