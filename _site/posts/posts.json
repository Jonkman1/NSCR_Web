This course is designed for beginners who are eager to explore the seamless\r\nintegration of generative AI technology, particularly OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs,\r\ninto the R programming language ecosystem. Through a series of interactive sessions,\r\nyou will gain hands-on experience in harnessing the power of generative AI (chatGTP)\r\nto enhance your R coding proficiency and streamline your data analytics workflows.\r\nThis course comprises three independent sessions, each focusing on specific aspects\r\nof ChatGPT integration in R:\r\nSession 1 (Tuesday April 2): Setup, Library Installations, and Introduction to ‘askgpt’ Library\r\nIn our initial session, we’ll lay the foundation for AI integration in R by guiding you through the setup process. You’ll learn how to install the necessary libraries and packages, configure your environment for seamless communication with OpenAI’s servers, and utilize the askgpt library for seeking coding assistance and troubleshooting from ChatGPT. By the end of this session, you’ll have established your development environment, installed 8 key libraries, and gained insights into using askgpt library.\r\nSession 2 (Monday April 15): Exploring ChatGPT Tools for R\r\nIn the second session, we’ll delve deeper into practical interaction with ChatGPT within the R environment. You’ll discover how to access ChatGPT’s capabilities directly from your R console using the air and TheOpenAIR packages. Additionally, we’ll explore integrating ChatGPT into interactive tutorials and educational materials using RTutor. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll uncover the versatility and utility of ChatGPT tools in augmenting your R coding experience.\r\nSession 3 (Tuesday April 30): Enhancing Workflow with AI Assistants\r\nOur final session will focus on leveraging AI assistants to streamline common tasks and accelerate development workflows in R. You’ll explore advanced features such as generating code snippets and prototypes based on natural language descriptions using gptstudio. Additionally, we’ll delve into automating repetitive tasks and enhancing productivity through AI-driven automation with gpttools and gptchatteR. By the end of this session, you’ll have unlocked new possibilities for efficiency and innovation in your R programming endeavours.\r\nDesigned for beginners\r\nThis course is designed for beginners, aiming to unlock new possibilities for efficiency and innovation in your R programming endeavours. Throughout our journey, emphasis will be placed on practical applications and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning objectives and empower you to seamlessly integrate AI into your R workflow.\r\nPreparation\r\nBefore our first session, it is advised that you install the latest version of R (version 4.4.3) on your computer, and that you register for a free account on the OpenAI platform and obtain your API key, which will allow you to interact with the ChatGPT model seamlessly. To do this, follow these steps:\r\nA. Obtaining your API key\r\nGo to https://openai.com/api/, register for a free account and obtain your API key located at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.\r\nB. Getting the API key\r\nClick on the OpenAI logo on the top left\r\nSelect “API keys”\r\nCreate new secret key\r\nGive it a name\r\nGive it “all” permissions\r\nClick: create secret key\r\nIMPORTANT: Copy the key before clicking “Done”\r\nSave the key in a Rstudio text file. That file is easiest called access_key.txt Use a .txt file with just the API key, no string quotation mark\r\nYou will be prompted to pre-pay for usage (I paid mine using a credit card). For the entire course you will need less than 3 euros.\r\n\r\nAbby Onencan is a researcher at the Erasmus School of Law at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

In this new season, we are transforming the advanced series of our workshops into a reading group format. Our aim is to offer a dynamic, interactive, and engaging way to explore the world of data analysis.\r\nJoin this session November 14, 2023 at 13:00 CET on Zoom by clicking here.\r\nRegression and other stories\r\nWe decided to work with the book Regression and other stories (ROS) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill and Aki Vehtari. This book was chosen because\r\nIt is freely available online, ensuring easy access for all participants.\r\nIt is packed with practical R examples that are also freely available online, enabling hands-on learning.\r\nIt covers a wealth of content on data analysis techniques used in criminological research.\r\nFormat\r\nThe format shifts from previous workshops to an interactive reading club approach. To keep participation maximally accessible to many, the sessions will continue to be online (on Zoom). To make them most instructive for everyone, we advice participants to read the designated chapter from Regression and other stories in advance and, when possible, practice with some of the examples. During the session, one of our team members will chair the discussion, where the participants will share their experiences and issues with the examples. The focus is on participation and collaborative learning, creating a relaxed atmosphere conducive to in-depth understanding. You can keep up to date with the material for each session via the corresponding GitHub repository.\r\nFor our first session, November 14, 2023 at 13:00 CET, we will introduce the new format and delve into Chapter 1 of Regression and Other Stories. Be prepared to discuss the chapter’s content, ask questions, and witness live coding in action.

Web scraping involves the extraction of data from websites, which can be done manually (e.g., copy-pasting) or automatically. This process extends beyond existing datasets, allowing you to retrieve any type of data found on a webpage. Once the information is saved to disk in HTML format, we can parse it to become more readable.\r\nIn this workshop, Danielle demonstrated how we can use the R package “rvest” to extract data from the NSC-R Workshops website. During this demonstration, she created a comprehensive dataset that encompasses the workshops conducted with the NSC-R community.\r\nContent of the workshop:\r\nWhat is web scraping and what is it used for?\r\nHTML basics\r\nWeb scraping and parsing in R\r\nRequired packages:\r\nFor web scraping and parsing: rvest\r\nFor tidy coding: dplyr\r\nTo read a little about web scraping, please refer to this source.\r\n\r\nDanielle van Westbroek-Stibbe is a PhD candidate at NSCR and Utrecht Universiteit and a member of the NSC-R Workshops team.

Quarto is a tool that helps you write research papers and blogs. It is a modern version of RMarkdown that is part of RStudio. Quarto can be used to write (reproducible) research papers and blogs that integrate text with data analysis and visualization.\r\nAfter the workshop we should know how Quarto works and understand the basic principles of making a blog, and can transfer this knowledge to writing a paper or report (or making a website, or book).\r\nTo profit most from this workshop, you need to have a very basic knowledge of R and R Markdown.\r\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking this link\r\n\r\nHarrie Jonkman recently retired. He was senior researcher at the Verwey-Jonker Institute. He worked in the field of education and prevention and the social and cognitive development of children and youngsters. You can find more information on his personal website. He has his own blog Harrie’s Hoekje on modern data-analysis.\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\nThe materials that Harrie used in his workshop are not only about Quarto, they were also produced using Quatro. Links to the Quarto-presentation and a Quarto-blog you find beneath. When you want to see how he made the presentation, the blog and the articles you find all the materials in three repositories on his GitHub space. So:\r\nThe introductory presentation you can find here. All the material for this presentation in Quarto you can find here\r\nThe Quarto-style blogversion of the NSC-R Workshops website is here.

You can name it whatever you want, but it is good practice to not include spaces. So, perhaps call it something like “tidytuesday_may2022”.\r\nOpen up RStudio. In the top left, you will see blue cube icon which when you hover over it will say Create a project. Click on this icon, choose existing directory, Browse, and then find and select the folder you have just created (e.g., tidytuesday_may2022). Once the folder has been selected, click Create Project.\r\nYou are now working in an R Project, hooray! One major benefit of working within an R Project is that all your working directories will now begin wherever the project is located (i.e., the tidytuesday_may2022 folder). Try this now by running getwd() in the R Console. If you save all your data, scripts and project materials here, or in subfolders, you will find it way easier to manage your work, and your code will look cleaner too, courtesy of the shorter working directories.\r\nLet’s start by creating some relevant folders in our project folder. You can do this manually, but let’s try it in RStudio. In the R Console, just type and run dir.create(\"scripts\"). This should have created a new folder called scripts in your project folder. You can save all your scripts here. Try it again for our data folder: dir.create(\"data\"). These subfolders should now existing within your project folder.\r\nFor the workshop, we are going to use some open data on 911 calls in Detroit, United States. I have written a very short script which loads the data automatically. You just need to download this script, save it in the scripts folder, and run it. You can find the script here. Either copy and paste the code into an R script, or right click on Raw (right hand side) and click Save link as…. Remember to save the script in your scripts folder.\r\nOpen up the script and run it. It should download the data automatically and then end with a brief summary of the data thanks to glimpse().\r\nTry to figure out the following. No pressure – you can ask us about anything queries or problems you have during the workshop!\r\nWhat variable names are in the data?\r\nHow many 911 calls for service (i.e., rows) do we have?\r\nWhat is the average response time (totalresponsetime) for calls?\r\nWhat is the most common call type? The call type is defined by the calldescription variable.\r\nHow many calls were in-progress shots fired (‘SHOTS FIRED IP’)?\r\nHow does average response time differ between call types? Here, you might want to use group_by().\r\nExplore some temporal trends. What hours of the day have the highest frequency of shots fired? Here, you will want to make use of functions in the lubridate package.\r\nSee you on Tuesday!\r\n\r\nSam Langton is a postdoc researcher on the evidence-based policing programme at the NSCR. His research focuses on describing and explaining the spatial and temporal patterning of police demand. Sam is interested in promoting open science in criminology, particularly through open data and sharing his knowledge (and struggles) in R.\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\nAll you need is the script mentioned above, which can be viewed here. Either copy and paste the code into an R script, or right click on Raw (right hand side) and click Save link as…. Remember to save the script in your scripts folder (see above).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

One (crime.csv) contains the number of police recorded residential burglaries, bike thefts and assaults in the Netherlands per month between January 2012 and April 2022. The other (population.csv) contains the number of inhabitants of the Netherlands during the same period, per first day of the month (below, in the Materials section, you can find a link to the R script that creates these files by downloading open data from Statistics Netherlands).\r\nIn the workshop we will together try to make sense of long-term temporal trends in these crimes, and hopefully also make useful statements about how things changed when the COVID pandemic arrived around February 2020.\r\nWe would suggest you just spend a single hour on preparation, no matter how far you get. Use any help you can find. Even very experienced R users consult the help files, their colleagues and the internet all the time, and so should you. Make sure you keep your R code in a script that you could share in the workshop, so we can learn from your ideas and creativity, and from your issues and errors.\r\nCreate a new folder on the computer where you run R, and store the two datafiles crime.csv and residents.csv in the folder.\r\nRead both files from disk and assign each a name. Any name will do, but I suggest “crime” and “ residents”.\r\nExplore the structure of the files. How many rows (observations), how many columns (variables), what are the variable names? What are their types: Are they integers, characters, dates, factors, …? keys?\r\nVisualize (plot) the development of the population size of the Netherlands between January 2012 and April 2022, and do the same for the frequencies of residential burglary, bike theft and assault.\r\nCreate a residential burglary rate by relating number of residential burglaries to the size of the population, and think about how you can adjust for different months having a differentnumbers of days (28-31). To do this, you will need to merge (join) the “crime” dataframe with the “residents” dataframe by year and month.\r\nVisualize the development of the three crime rates.\r\nWhat can we say about the development of crime since February 2020, relative to the developments between 2012 and 2020? How can you quantify this with the data at hand?\r\nDo anything else with the data that you find fun or seems to make sense\r\n\r\nWim Bernasco is senior researcher at NSCR and professor at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

    "contents": "\r\nDiscrete choice is choosing a single item or action from a finite set of alternatives. We do it all the time, when we shop for new clothes, select a dish from the menu, choose to commute by bus, train or bike, select a job or an applicant, or when we swipe potential partners on Tinder.\r\nDiscrete spatial choice is when the alternatives are spatial entities, e.g. when we choose where to buy a house, where to go on holiday, or where to commit a crime. With data on what has been chosen and on what could have been chosen, discrete choice models can help us understand the decision process and predict its outcome: how do features of the alternatives (e.g. monetary cost of profits, distance, comfort, taste, looks) affect which alternative is chosen?\r\nIn this workshop, Wim Bernasco explained the key elements of discrete choice models, just enough for you to get going and still know what you are doing. Subsequently he showed what the necessary data look like, how they can be organized, and how discrete choice models can be estimated in R.\r\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking this link\r\n\r\nWim Bernasco is senior researcher at NSCR and professor at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Network analysis concerns the analytical approach to study these edges between nodes of any kind (e.g., individuals, businesses, experiences, words, or streets). The workshop proceeds with an introduction to network analysis in R, focusing on i) creating and reading network data; ii) describing and visualizing networks; and iii) explaining the formation of networks.\r\nJoin this workshop meeting on Thursday January 20, 2022 at 13:00 on Zoom by clicking this link\r\nTo prepare for the workshop, you may want to install a few R packages (just copy and paste these lines into your R Studio Editor and run them):\r\ninstall.packages(“tidyverse”)\r\ninstall.packages(“igraph”)\r\ninstall.packages(“tidygraph”)\r\ninstall.packages(“ggraph”)\r\ninstall.packages(“statnet”)\r\n\r\nIeke de Vries is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology at Leiden University. In her current work, she applies a network approach to examine co-arrest and spatial networks in Chicago, social and spatial networks in the context of human trafficking, and networks of victimizing experiences and behaviors. Besides conducting her research mostly in R, she has also taught an ‘Introduction to Computational Statistics in R’ to graduate students and ‘Programming with Data in Python’ to undergraduate students at Northeastern University and a Summer Course on ‘Crime, Data, and Ethics’ to honours students at Leiden University.\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\nMaterials for the workshop are available at Github.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nAccording to David Buil-Gil, victimization surveys provide key information about crimes known and unknown to the police, and are the main source of data to analyse perceived safety and confidence in policing. These surveys, however, are only designed to allow aggregating responses and producing reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation techniques may be used to improve the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are applied to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. This workshop will introduce theory and show a step-by-step exemplar study in R to illustrate the utility of small area estimation for crime and place research. You find materials here. And his presentation here\r\n\r\nDavid Buil-Gil is a Lecturer in Quantitative Criminology at the Department of Criminology of the University of Manchester, and a core member of the Manchester Centre for Digital Trust and Society. His research areas cover geographic criminology, small area estimation applications in criminology, measurement error in criminological research, new methods for data collection, and open data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
