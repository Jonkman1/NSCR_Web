    "contents": "\nAccording to David Buil-Gil, victimization surveys provide key information about crimes known and unknown to the police, and are the main source of data to analyse perceived safety and confidence in policing. These surveys, however, are only designed to allow aggregating responses and producing reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation techniques may be used to improve the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are applied to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. This workshop will introduce theory and show a step-by-step exemplar study in R to illustrate the utility of small area estimation for crime and place research.\n\nDavid Buil-Gil is a Lecturer in Quantitative Criminology at the Department of Criminology of the University of Manchester, and a core member of the Manchester Centre for Digital Trust and Society. His research areas cover geographic criminology, small area estimation applications in criminology, measurement error in criminological research, new methods for data collection, and open data.\n\n\n\n\n",

For analyses he has used Excel, SPSS, Stata Mplus, MLWiN, and QGis. Not a big fan of C++ and Java, but once upon a time he knew the basics. Wouter started using R around 2012, due to a collaboration with a visiting scholar who used R.

His main research interests are in spatial patterns of crime and quantitative research methods.\n\n\nStijn is a Senior Researcher and management team member at the NSCR. He is program leader of two of its five research groups, and also Professor at the Department of Sociology, Utrecht University. Stijn has used R ever since he attended the Summer School in Ann Arbor in 2004, even for generating his kitchen tiling pattern. His main research interests are in Geographic and Environmental Criminology, Policing, Quantitative, Analytical, and Computational Sociology, and he is a great believer in Open Science and Open-source.\n\n\n\n\n",

In this workshop, we worked on the basic concepts of spatial data usage, data preparation, and basic visualisations. The aim was to introduce you to how to work with spatial data in R and provide materials that helped to go deeper into this type of data.\nTo prepare for the meeting, Alex suggested you might want to take a look at the following links. This is obviously not mandatory, but the materials may give rise to ideas or questions that you may want to discuss in the workshop meeting:\nLovelance, R., Nowosad, J., & Muenchow, J. Geocomputation with R. CRC Press.\nBivand, R. S., Pebesba, E., & Gómez-Rubio, V. Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R. Springer.(Access from university library)\nScripts and data you can find here.\n\nAlex is a postdoctoral researcher at the NSCR and the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU. His interest in spatial analysis began when he started his PhD, exploring the spatial distribution of juvenile delinquency and the contextual factors associated with it. It was also during his PhD that he began his journey with R.\n\n\n\n\n",

If you remember Thomas de Graaff’s talk from two weeks ago, having human readable code is important for a number of reasons, such as being easy to debug, maintain, and extend.\nRMarkdown is simply a software that allows the implementation of this language in R. This makes it possible to produce open-access, fully reproducible documents.\nTo show you the basics, Asier followed the book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Xie, Allaire and Grolemund. He recommends you read the Preface before the workshop. However, as a definitive guide, you can deduce that this book does not only cover the basics, so you can also use it to go deeper.\nTo have all the main commands at hand, you can print this double-sided RMarkdown cheat sheet.
