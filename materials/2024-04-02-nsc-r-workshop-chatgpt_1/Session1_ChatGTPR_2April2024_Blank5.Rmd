## Session One: Setup and Packages "askgpt" and "air"

> ### 1. OPENAI CHAT GPT SETUP

#### *Step 1: Obtain API Key*

Obtain an API key from OpenAI at [<https://openai.com/api/%5D>. Click on
"API keys" under "Manage Account" to create a new key.

#### *Step 2: Load Necessary Libraries:*

```{r}
    # library(httr) for making HTTP requests
    # library(jsonlite) to load a JSON parser and Generator
```

#### *Step 3: Define your OpenAI API key and request body:*

1.  Define your OpenAI AP
2.  Define request body
3.  Choose a model
4.  Define the test message
5.  Set the maximum tokens
6.  Set the temperature

```{r}

```

#### *Step 4: Test request completion:*

```{r}
# Send the POST request to OpenAI


# Extract and print the response

```

*If you encounter error:*

1.  Verify proper API key
2.  Check monthly API limit from OpenAI
3.  Ensure you're within the API limit
4.  Confirm API key access to the desired model

> ### 2. PACKAGE ASKGPT

-   Created by Johannes Gruber, the askgpt package is [available on
    CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/askgpt/index.html).

-   New to R? Confused by tutorial code or error messages? Use askgpt!
    [More
    information](https://github.com/JBGruber/askgpt?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)

-   Users can utilize the **chat_api()** function to set OpenAI API
    parameters.

-   It's like R's ChatGPT, offering help on errors and providing a handy
    RStudio addin for annotating code.

-   The package offers a general **askgpt()** function for queries.

-   Also there are coding-specific functions like **annotate_code()**,
    **explain_code()**, and **test_function()**.

```{r}
 # library(askgpt) for Asking GPT About R Stuff
```

#### 1. The most important setting, however, is askgpt_config

options(askgpt_config = "I'm 8 years old, please explain things easily")

askgpt("What is an R function?")

```{r}

```

#### 2. Get to know each other:

askgpt("who are you?")

```{r}

```

#### 3. Login help:

askgpt("How do I login to chatgpt?")

```{r}

```

#### 4. You are new to Rstudio and have no idea where to start:

askgpt("I have no idea how to use Rstudio, help")

```{r}

```

#### 5. Knit problems with askgpt:

askgpt("do you know why I cannot knit when I am using askgpt?")

```{r}

```

#### 6. Ask a coding question and save as a variable:

-   `askgpt`'s default is to store the results of your query as an
    object and they can be saved as a variable (linechart_instructions
    \<-).

-   askgpt("askgpt("Create a line graph with multiple lines representing
    different groups (old, young, infants), use the provided sample data
    and ggplot2 library in R. Finally, print the line graph." )

```{r}

```

*Check if the askgpt solution works*

```{r}
# Create sample data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
age = rep(c("old", "young", "infants"), each = 10),
value = rnorm(30),
time = rep(1:10, 3)
)

# Load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Create a line graph with multiple lines representing different groups
ggplot(data, aes(x = time, y = value, color = age, linetype = age)) +
geom_line() +
scale_color_manual(values = c("old" = "blue", "young" = "red", "infants" = "purple")) +
scale_linetype_manual(values = c("old" = "solid", "young" = "dashed", "infants" = "dotted")) +
labs(title = "Line Graph with Multiple Lines",
x = "Time",
y = "Value")
```

#### 7. Annotate_code() function

askgpt("give an example when I can use annotate_code function and
explain why I need it")

```{r}

```

#### 8. Explain_code() function

askgpt("give an example when I can use explain_code function and explain
why I need it")

```{r}

```

#### 9. Test_function()

askgpt("give an example when I can use test_function() and explain why I
need it")

```{r}

```

#### 10. Askgpt prompts:

askgpt("list a number of askgpt prompts used by r programmers" )

```{r}

```

*NB: These prompts are more conversational and answering the question
**WHY** and **WHAT** - barely the question **HOW,** so you need another
package if you are more interested with HOW R programming prompts.*

> ### 3. PACKAGE "AIR"

-   Created by **Professor Soumya Ray** from the College of Technology
    Management at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. It is
    [available on
    CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/air/index.html).
-   Designed exclusively for R-related queries (doesn't support other
    programming languages).
-   The air R package provides R users with a chat-like feature akin to
    GitHub Copilot.
-   Answers appear in your R console, not in your script unless you use
    **R Notebook**.
-   The air package, available on CRAN, provides setup instructions on
    its [GitHub README page](https://github.com/soumyaray/air).
-   Use **air::set_key()** as asecure method for storing OpenAI keys
    (via a pop-up window)
-   Use **set_model()** to choose models other than the default gpt-4.
-   It offers two functions: **howto()** and **whatis().**

*Make sure you define your OpenAI API key and request body before using
"air"*

*First things first: Load Library "air"*

```{r}
library(air)    # An AI Assistant to Write and Undestand R Code
```

#### 1. Bar chart:howto()

*You must connect an OpenAI API key before using the howto() function.*

howto("Create a bar chart in R where the bars are colored (steel blue,
green, orange and yellow)and the bars are ordered by descending Y value
and print it")

```{r}
howto("Create a bar chart in R where the bars are colored (steel blue, green, 
      orange and yellow)and the bars are ordered by descending Y value and 
      print it")
```

*Check if the package "air" solution works:*

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data <- data.frame(
  category = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
  value = c(10, 8, 6, 4),
  color = c("steelblue", "green", "orange", "yellow")
)
data <- data[order(-data$value), ]

ggplot(data, aes(x = category, y = value, fill = color)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

#### 2. Line <graph:howto>()

howto("Create a line graph in R with multiple lines representing
different groups (old, young, infants), each with different colours and
style. Print the results as output in R Notebook" )

```{r}
howto("Create a line graph in R with multiple lines representing different 
      groups (old, young, infants), each with different colours and style. 
      Print the results as output in R Notebook" )
```

*Check if the package "air" solution works:*

```{r}
# Sample data 
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
  age = rep(1:10, 3),
  group = rep(c("old", "young", "infants"), each = 10),
  value = c(rnorm(10, 20, 5), rnorm(10, 25, 5), rnorm(10, 15, 3))
)

# Load required library
library(ggplot2)

# Line plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = value, color = group, linetype = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "purple")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c("solid", "dashed", "dotted"))
```

#### 3. Scatter plot:howto()

howto("Produce a scatter plot in R with customized point shapes and
colors based on a categorical variable, name the variables (cats, dogs,
horses, cows) and produce a key. Print the results as output in R
Markdown.")

```{r}
howto("Produce a scatter plot in R with customized point shapes and colors 
      based on a categorical variable, name the variables (cats, dogs, horses, 
      cows) and produce a key. Print the results as output in R Markdown.")
```

*Check if the package "air" solution works:*

```{r}
# Sample data
animals <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100),
  type = sample(c("cats", "dogs", "horses", "cows"), 100, replace = TRUE)
)

# Scatter plot
plot(animals$x, animals$y, col = ifelse(animals$type == "cats", "red",
                  ifelse(animals$type == "dogs", "blue",
                  ifelse(animals$type == "horses", "green", "yellow"))),
     pch = ifelse(animals$type == "cats", 1,
            ifelse(animals$type == "dogs", 4,
            ifelse(animals$type == "horses", 5, 8))),
     main = "Animal Scatter Plot",
     xlab = "X-axis",
     ylab = "Y-axis")
legend("topright", legend = unique(animals$type), pch = c(1, 4, 5, 8),
       col = c("red", "blue", "green", "yellow"), title = "Types")
